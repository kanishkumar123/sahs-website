          <h2>Our Legacy and Growth</h2>
          <p>
            Vinayaka Mission’s Research Foundation (Deemed to be University)
            traces its origin back to 1981 with the establishment of the
            Thirumuruga Kirupananda Variyar Thavathiru Sundara Swamigal Medical
            Educational and Charitable Trust (TKVTSSMECT). Building upon this
            foundation, the visionary Founder-Chairman, Dr. A. Shanmugasundaram,
            founded the Vinayaka Mission's College of Pharmacy at Salem in 1982,
            marking the pioneering step of Vinayaka Missions in the realm of
            education.

            In 2001, Vinayaka Missions attained the prestigious status of a
            "Deemed to be University," as recognized by the Ministry of Human
            Resources Development, Government of India, with the endorsement of
            the University Grants Commission (UGC) under Section 3 of the UGC
            Act, 1956. This accolade acknowledged the institution's unwavering
            commitment to academic excellence, fulfillment of the highest
            academic benchmarks, and provision of exceptional infrastructure,
            establishing its eminence in education. This milestone transformed
            Vinayaka Missions into Vinayaka Mission’s Research Foundation
            (VMRF), marking its distinction as the 48th Deemed to be University
            in India.
