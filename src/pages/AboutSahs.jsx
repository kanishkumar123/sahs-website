          <h2>Allied and Healthcare Professionals (AHPs)</h2>
          <p>
            Allied and Healthcare Professionals (AHPs) include individuals
            involved in the delivery of health or health care-related services
            with qualifications and competence in therapeutic, diagnostic,
            curative, preventive, and/or rehabilitative interventions. They work
            in multidisciplinary health teams in various healthcare settings,
            including doctors (physicians and specialists), nurses, and public
            health officials, to promote, protect, treat, and/or manage a
            person’s physical, mental, social, emotional, and environmental
            health and holistic well-being. The modern healthcare system is
            technology-oriented and growing at a very fast pace with the
            introduction and upgradation of newer technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a significant need for technocrats to handle high-end
            sophisticated equipment. AHPs are distinct from trained technicians,
            who may have expertise in practical skills but lack deep scientific
            knowledge of the subject. Allied and Healthcare professionals
            possess both theoretical and practical knowledge in their subject
            domain.

          <h2>Expectations from AHPs</h2>
          <p>
            Allied and Healthcare professionals are expected to show proficiency
            in clinical care, possess good communication skills, and work
            effectively as team players in multidisciplinary teams. They exhibit
            ethics and accountability at all levels, express commitment to
            professional excellence, hold leadership and mentorship qualities,
            are socially accountable, exhibit a scientific attitude, and are
            lifelong learners.
